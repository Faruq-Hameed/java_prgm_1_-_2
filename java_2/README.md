## Method to Test For Equality - "equals"
The equals method checks by default whether the object given as a parameter has the same reference as the object it is being compared to. In other words, the default behaviour checks whether the two objects are the same. If the reference is the same, the method returns true, and false otherwise.
If a class does not have its own implementation of the equals method,  it falls back on the default implementation provided by Java when the equals method is invoked. The default implementation of the equals method checks just like the toString method does, whether the two objects have the same reference.
Even though if the variables of two object have the same values, equals works as expected in that it declares two strings identical in content to be 'equal' even if they are two separate objects. The String class has replaced the default equals with its own implementation.
If we want to compare our own classes using the equals method, then it must be defined inside the class. The method created accepts an Object-type reference as a parameter, which can be any object. The comparison first looks at the references. This is followed by checking the parameter object's type with the instanceof operation - if the object type does not match the type of our class, the object cannot be the same. We then create a version of the object that is of the same type as our class, after which the object variables are compared against each other.
The ArrayList also uses the equals method in its internal implementation. If we don't define the equals method in our objects, the contains method of the ArrayList does not work properly.

This reliance on default methods such as equals is actually the reason why Java demands that variables added to ArrayList and HashMap are of reference type. Each reference type variable comes with default methods, such as equals, which means that you don't need to change the internal implementation of the ArrayList class when adding variables of different types. Primitive variables do not have such default methods.
