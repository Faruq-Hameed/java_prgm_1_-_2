### Handling collections as streams

Let's get to know collections, such as lists, as streams of values. Stream is a way of going through a collection of data such that the programmer determines the operation to be performed on each value. No record is kept of the index or the variable being processed at any given time.

With streams, the programmer defines a sequence of events that is executed for each value in a collection. An event chain may include dumping some of the values, converting values ​​from one form to another, or calculations. A stream does not change the values ​​in the original data collection, but merely processes them. If you want to retain the transformations, they need to be compiled into another data collection.
A stream can be formed from any object that implements the Collection interface (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, ...) with the stream() method. The string values ​​are then converted ("mapped") to desired types e.g (integer form) using the stream's (e.g mapToInt(value -> conversion) map integer )method. The conversion is implemented by the valueOf method of the Object (e.g Integer class), which we've used in the past. We then use the filter (value -> filter condition) method e.g (to filter out only those numbers that are divisible by three) for further processing. Finally, we can call the stream's count() method, which counts the number of elements in the stream and returns it as a long type variable if we are working with number collections.

A brief summary of the stream methods we've encountered so far.

# Purpose and method Assumptions

- Stream formation: stream()	The method is called on collection that implements the Collection interface, such as an ArrayList Object. Something is done on the created stream.

- Converting a stream into an integer stream: mapToInt(value -> another)	The stream transforms into one containing integers. A stream containing strings can be converted using, for instance, the valueOf method of the Integer class. Something is done with the stream containing integers.

- Filtering values: filter(value -> filter condition)	The elements that do not satisfy the filter condition are removed from the string. On the right side of the arrow is a statement that returns a boolean. If the boolean is true, the element is accepted into the stream. If the boolean evaluates to false, the value is not accepted into the stream. Something is done with the filtered values.

- Calculating the average: average()	Returns a OptionalDouble-type object that has a method getAsDouble() that returns a value of type double. Calling the method average() works on streams that contain integers - they can be created with the mapToInt method.

- Counting the number of elements in a stream: count()	Returns the number of elements in a stream as a long-type value

## Lambda Expressions
Stream values ​​are handled by methods related to streams. Methods that handle values ​​get a function as a parameter that determines what is done with each element. What the function does is specific to the method in question. For instance, the filter method used for filtering elements is provided a function which returns a boolean true or false, depending on whether to keep the value in the stream or not. The mapToInt method used for transformation is, on the other hand, provided a function which converts the value to an integer, and so on.

# Why are the functions written in the form value -> value > 5?
The expression above, i.e., a *lambda expression,*  is shorthand provided by Java for anonymous methods that do not have an "owner", i.e., they are not part of a class or an interface. The function contains both the parameter definition and the function body. The same function can be written in several different ways.
The same can be written explicitly so that a static method is defined in the program, which gets used within the function passed to the stream as a parameter.
The function can also be passed directly as a parameter. The syntax found below Screeners::greaterThanFive is saying: "use the static greaterThanFive method that's in the Screeners class". The method receive the present element in the list as value meaning that the method must be expecting that value and type.
Functions that handle stream elements ​​cannot change values ​​of variables outside of the function. This has to do with how static methods behave - during a method call, there is no access to any variables outside of the method. With functions, the values ​​of variables outside the function can be read, assuming that those values of those variables do not change in the program. So any variable declared outside of the the stream method call cannot be modified but can be read and used.Variables declared outside of an anonymous function cannot be used, it wont work.

# Stream Methods
Stream methods can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) intermediate operations intended for processing elements ​​and (2) terminal operations that end the processing of elements. Both of the filter and mapToInt methods shown in the previous example are intermediate operations. Intermediate operations return a value that can be further processed - you could, in practice, have an infinite number of intermediate operations chained sequentially (& separated by a dot). Intermediate operations  transform a stream and return another stream. They are lazy and only executed when a terminal operation is invoked.  On the other hand, the average method seen in the previous example is a terminal operation. A terminal operation returns a value to be processed, which is formed from, for instance, stream elements. - Terminal operations (like forEach, collect, reduce, average) trigger the processing of the stream and produce a non-stream result (like a value or a collection). They returns a result derived from the processed stream elements.- The stream is closed after this — it cannot be reused or reprocessed.
 The collect() method in Java Streams is one of the most powerful and flexible terminal operations. It’s used to gather the elements of a stream into a container like a List, Set, Map, or even a custom result.
 - collect() is a terminal operation that transforms a stream into a collection or summary result.
- It uses Collectors — utility methods from java.util.stream.Collectors — to define how the stream should be collected.


# Terminal Operations
Common terminal operations: the count method for counting the number of values on a list, the forEach method for going a through list values, the collect method for gathering the list values ​​into a data structure, and the reduce method for combining the list items.
- The count method informs us of the number of values in the stream as a long-type variable.

- The forEach method defines what is done to each list value and terminates the stream processing.
- You can use the collect method to collect stream values into another collection. The example below creates a new list containing only positive values. The collect method is given as a parameter to the Collectors object to which the stream values ​​are collected - for example, calling Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new) creates a new ArrayList object that holds the collected values.
- The reduce method is useful when you want to combine stream elements to some other form. The parameters accepted by the method have the following format: reduce(*initialState*, (*previous*, *object*) -> *actions on the object*).

# Intermediate Operations
Intermediate stream operations are methods that return a stream. Since the value returned is a stream, we can call intermediate operations sequentially. Typical intermediate operations include converting a value from one form to another using map and its more specific form mapToInt used for converting a stream to an integer stream. Other ones include filtering values with filter, identifying unique values with distinct, and arranging values with sorted (if possible).
- distinct-method, that returns a stream that only contains unique values
- The method sorted, which sorts the strings.
The distinct-method described above uses the equals-method that is in all objects for comparing whether two strings are the same. The sorted-method on the other hand is able to sort objects that contain some kind of order — examples of this kind of objects are for example numbers and strings.

# Objects and Stream
Handling objects using stream methods is natural. Each stream method that deals with the stream's values ​​also enables you to call methods related to values.
Streams can also be used to build more complex string representations. 

# Files and Streams
Stream methods make the reading of files that are of predefined format relatively straightforward.

# The Comparable Interface
The Comparable interface defines the compareTo method used to compare objects. If a class implements the Comparable interface, objects created from that class can be sorted using Java's sorting algorithms.
The compareTo method required by the Comparable interface receives as its parameter the object to which the "this" object is compared. If the "this" object comes before the object received as a parameter in terms of sorting order, the method should return a negative number. If, on the other hand, the "this" object comes after the object received as a parameter, the method should return a positive number. Otherwise, 0 is returned. The sorting resulting from the compareTo method is called natural ordering.
The compareTo method required by the interface returns an integer that informs us of the order of comparison.
ALso returning a negative number from compareTo() is enough if the this object is smaller than the parameter object, and returning zero is sufficient when the lengths are the same
Since the implementing class implements the Comparable interface, it is possible to sort the list by using the sorted method. In fact, objects of any class that implement the Comparable interface can be sorted using the sorted method. Be aware, however, _that a stream does not sort the original list - only the items in the stream are sorted._

If a programmer wants to organize the original list, the sort method of the Collections class should be used. This, of course, assumes that the objects on the list implement the Comparable interface.
String.compareTo() also treats letters according to their size, while the compareToIgnoreCase method of the same class ignores the capitalization completely.

# Implementing Multiple Interfaces
A class can implement multiple interfaces. Multiple interfaces are implemented by separating the implemented interfaces with commas (public class ... implements *FirstInterface*, *SecondInterface* ...). Implementing multiple interfaces requires us to implement all of the methods for which implementations are required by the interfaces.

# Sorting Method as a Lambda Expression
We can sort a list without having to implement the Comparable interface.
Both the sort method of the Collections class and the stream's sorted method accept a lambda expression as a parameter that defines the sorting criteria. More specifically, both methods can be provided with an object that implements the Comparator interface, which defines the desired order - the lambda expression is used to create this object.
this will sort;
persons.stream().sorted((p1, p2) -> {
    return p1.getBirthYear() - p2.getBirthYear(); //this will handle the sorting in ascending order
}).forEach(p -> System.out.println(p.getName())); //the item will printed in sorted order here in ascending order
Collections.sort(persons, (p1, p2) -> p1.getBirthYear() - p2.getBirthYear()); //this will sort and mutate original list

When comparing strings, we can use the compareTo method provided by the String class. The method returns an integer that describes the order of both the string given to it as a parameter and the string that's calling it.
persons.stream().sorted((p1, p2) -> {
    return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
}).forEach(p -> System.out.println(p.getName()));
WE use Double.compare to sort double - Safe: Avoids precision loss and overflow issues.
- Handles NaN and -0.0/+0.0 correctly.
- Returns:
- Negative if this.literacyPercent < other.literacyPercent
- Zero if equal
- Positive if greater
If you're sorting in descending order, just reverse the arguments

# Sorting By Multiple Criteria
We sometimes want to sort items based on a number of things. We can make use of Java's Comparator class here, which offers us the functionality required for sorting.
The Comparator class provides two essential methods for sorting: comparing and thenComparing. The comparing method is passed the value to be compared first, and the thenComparing method is the next value to be compared. The thenComparing method can be used many times by chaining methods, which allows virtually unlimited values ​​to be used for comparison.
When we sort objects, the comparing and thenComparing methods are given a reference to the object's type - the method is called in order and the values ​​returned by the method are compared. The method reference is given as Class::method.
🥇 Primary Comparator Takes Precedence
- The first comparator passed to Comparator.comparing() is the most important.
- It defines the primary sort order.
- If two elements are equal according to this comparator, then the next comparator in the chain (thenComparing) is used.

📐 Order of thenComparing() Matters
- The sequence of thenComparing() calls defines the tie-breaking hierarchy.
- Each subsequent comparator is only used if all previous ones result in equality.
- Changing the order of these calls can completely change the sort result.

### StringBuilder
String creation - although unnoticeable at a small scale - is not a quick operation. Space is allocated in memory for each string where the string is then placed. If the string is only needed as part of creating a larger string, performance should be improved.
Java's ready-made StringBuilder class provides a way to concatenate strings without the need to create them. A new StringBuilder object is created with a new StringBuilder() call, and content is added to the object using the overloaded append method, i.e., there are variations of it for different types of variables. Finally, the StringBuilder object provides a string using the toString method.

## Regular Expressions
A regular expression defines a set of strings in a compact form. Regular expressions are used, among other things, to verify the correctness of strings. We can assess whether or not a string is in the desired form by using a regular expression that defines the strings considered correct.
Checking correctness with the help of regular expressions is done by first defining a suitable regular expression. We can then use the matches method of the String class, which checks whether the string matches the regular expression given as a parameter

# most common characters used in regular expressions
The most common characters used in regular expressions include metacharacters like ., *, +, ?, [], (), ^, $, and |, which help define powerful search patterns.
Here’s a breakdown of the most frequently used regex characters and their meanings:
🔤 Character Classes
- . — Matches any single character except newline.
- \d — Matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).
- \w — Matches any word character (letters, digits, underscore).
- \s — Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
- \D, \W, \S — Negations of the above.
🔁 Quantifiers
- * — Matches 0 or more of the preceding element.
- + — Matches 1 or more of the preceding element.
- ? — Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding element.
- {n} — Matches exactly n occurrences.
- {n,} — Matches n or more occurrences.
- {n,m} — Matches between n and m occurrences.
🧱 Anchors
- ^ — Matches the start of a string.
- $ — Matches the end of a string.
🧩 Grouping and Alternation
- () — Groups expressions and captures matched text.
- | — Acts like a logical OR (e.g., cat|dog matches either).
🔣 Character Sets
- [] — Matches any one character inside the brackets.
- [a-z] — Matches any lowercase letter.
- [^a-z] — Matches any character not in the range.
🔐 Escape Character
- \ — Escapes a metacharacter to treat it as a literal (e.g., \. matches a period).
# Alternation (Vertical Line)
A vertical line indicates that parts of a regular expressions are optional. For example, 00|111|0000 defines the strings 00, 111 and 0000. The respond method returns true if the string matches any one of the specified group of alternatives. The regular expression 00|111|0000 demands that the string is exactly it specifies it to be - there is no "contains" functionality i.e it must be exactly one of the union.

# Affecting Part of a String (Parentheses)
You can use parentheses to determine which part of a regular expression is affected by the rules inside the parentheses. Say we want to allow the strings 00000 and 00001. We can do that by placing a vertical bar in between them this way 00000|00001. Parentheses allow us to limit the option to a specific part of the string. The expression 0000(0|1) specifies the strings 00000 and 00001.

Similarly, the regular expression car(|s|) defines the singular (car) and plural (cars) forms of the word car.

# Quantifiers
What is often desired is that a particular sub-string is repeated in a string. The following expressions are available in regular expressions:
- The quantifier * repeats 0 ... times, str.matches(trolo(lo)*) i.e the lo appears from 0 to many times after trolo
- The quantifier + repeats 1 ... times  i.e can be repeated from i times upward
- The quantifier ? repeats 0 or 1 times i.e can be repeated either zero or one time
- The quantifier {a} repeats a times i.e repeated in the a times
- The quantifier {a,b} repeats a ... b i.e b repeated btw a to b times
-  The quantifier {a,} repeats a ... times, i.e repeated from a times upward
You can use more than one quantifier in a single regular expression. For example, the regular expression 5{3}(1|0)*5{3} defines strings that begin and end with three fives. An unlimited number of ones and zeros are allowed in between.

# Character Classes (Square Brackets)
A character class can be used to specify a set of characters in a compact way. Characters are enclosed in square brackets, and a range is indicated with a dash. For example, [145] means (1|4|5) and [2-36-9] means (2|3|6|7|8|9). Similarly, the entry [a-c]* defines a regular expression that requires the string to contain only a, b and c.
Regular expressions come in handy in certain situations. In some cases the expressions become too complex, and the "correctness" of the string is best checked with some other style. Or it could be beneficial to use regular expressions for only some part of the check.

_Almost all programming languages ​​support regular expressions nowadays. The theory of regular expressions is one of the topics considered in the course Computational Models (TKT-20005). You can find more regular expressions by googling regular expressions java, for instance._

## Enumerated Type - Enum
An enumerated type, or enum, is a special data type that enables a variable to be a set of predefined constants. Enums are commonly used when a variable (especially a method parameter or return value) can only take one out of a small set of possible values. If we know the possible values ​​of a variable in advance, we can use a class of type enum, i.e., enumerated type to represent the values. Enumerated types are their own type in addition to being normal classes and interfaces. An enumerated type is defined by the keyword enum. For example, the following Suit enum class defines four constant values: DIAMOND, SPADE, CLUB and HEART.
In its simplest form, enum lists the constant values ​​it declares, separated by a comma. Enum types, i.e., constants, are conventionally written with capital letters.
An Enum is (usually) written in its own file, much like a class or interface. In NetBeans, you can create an Enum by selecting new/other/java/java enum from project.

# Comparing Enums
Each enum field gets a unique number code, and they can be compared using the equals sign. Just as other classes in Java, these values also inherit the Object class and its equals method. The equals method compares this numeric identifier in enum types too.
The numeric identifier of an enum field value can be found with ordinal(). The method actually returns an order number - if the enum value is presented first, its order number is 0. If its second, the order number is 1, and so on. - Every enum constant (like MONDAY, TUESDAY, etc.) has a position in the enum declaration.
- This position is called the ordinal, and it's a number starting from 0
🧮 Comparing Enums
- You can compare enums using:
- == → checks if two enum references point to the same constant (fast and safe).
- .equals() → checks if two enum objects are equal (also safe, but more general).
- 
- 
- .equals() compares the reference identity, not the ordinal.
- The ordinal is just a number you can retrieve, not something used in equality checks.

# Object References In Enums
Enums in Java aren't just limited to simple constants — they can also hold object references, making them powerful tools for modeling complex data. Here's how that works:
Each enum constant can be associated with fields, including references to other objects. This allows enums to behave like full-fledged classes.

📦 Example: Enum with Object References
Suppose you have a Card class and want each Suit enum to hold a reference to a color object:
class Color {
    String name;
    public Color(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public enum Suit {
    DIAMOND(new Color("Red")),
    CLUB(new Color("Black")),
    HEART(new Color("Red")),
    SPADE(new Color("Black"));

    private final Color color;

    Suit(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public Color getColor() {
        return color;
    }
}


🧪 Usage
System.out.println(Suit.HEART.getColor().name); // Output: Red



🔍 Why Use Object References in Enums?
- Encapsulation: Bundle related data with the enum constant.
- Cleaner code: Avoids external mapping structures like Map<Suit, Color>.
- Behavior-rich enums: You can add methods that operate on the associated objects.

⚠️ Things to Watch Out For
- Enum constants are static and final, so their associated objects should be immutable or used carefully.
- Avoid heavy object creation inside enum constructors unless necessary — it can affect performance and memory.
Would you like to see an example where enums hold references to strategy objects or database configurations?
Enumerated types may contain object reference variables. The values ​​of the reference variables should be set in an internal constructor of the class defining the enumerated type, i.e., within a constructor having a private access modifier. Enum type classes cannot have a public constructor.

# Iterator
ArrayList and other "object containers" that implement the Collection interface implement the Iterable interface, and they can also be iterated over with the help of an iterator - an object specifically designed to go through a particular type of object collection.
The iterator is requested from the cards list containing cards. The iterator can be thought of as a "finger" that always points to a particular object inside the list. Initially it points to the first item, then to the next, and so on... until all the objects have been gone through with the help of the "finger".

The iterator offers a few methods. The hasNext() method is used to ask if there are any objects still to be iterated over. If there are, the next object in line can be requested from the iterator using the next() method. This method returns the next object in line to be processed and moves the iterator, or "finger", to point to the following object in the collection.

The object reference returned by the iterator's next method can of course also be stored in a variable. 
If you want to remove some of the objects from the list during a traversal, you can do so using an iterator. Calling the remove method of the iterator object neatly removes form the list the item returned by the iterator with the previous next call. As modification of a list in a forEach stream not possible.

- iterator.next() moves the cursor forward and returns the current item.
- By storing it in a variable (current), you can:
- Inspect it (current.getKey(), current.getValue())
- Modify it (current.setValue(...))
- Remove it (iterator.remove() — which removes the last item returned by next())
